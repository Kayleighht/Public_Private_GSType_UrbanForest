## Abstract
The urban forest is made up of the trees and associated green spaces in parks, streets, private land and natural areas within the city. A diverse urban forest provides resilience to environmental change (such as climate change, or insect outbreaks) while also providing numerous benefits to people. As part of the urban landscape, trees are a key contributor to biodiversity and ecosystem services like temperature regulation, pollution reduction and recreation. To better measure and understand these benefits, researchers need an inventory of city trees. Our current understanding of Montreal's urban forest has been largely limited to trees located on public land. However, half of all city trees are growing on privately managed land â€“ and the characteristics of these trees are not well understood. Using a mixed method approach combining a traditional field inventory and community science project, we built a tree inventory at an urban forest plot in Notre-Dame-de-Grace Montreal, Canada across four green space types in the public and private domain. We found that the inclusion of private trees contributed an additional 52 species (30%) not found in the current public tree inventory. We also found that patterns of diversity depended on the scale at which they were assessed. We show that preserving green space types at the scale they are managed is relevant for patterns of tree diversity, however difficulties still remain when controlling for large differences in area. Overall, our findings highlight the potential for more fine-scale tree management opportunities to promote urban forest diversity and resilience and the importance of considering multiple scales of analysis in urban forestry work.
